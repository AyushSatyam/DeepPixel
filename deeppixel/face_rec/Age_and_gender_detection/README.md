## Detection of Faces in image

To detect age and gender of faces in the input image given and saves labelled output images in given folder 

### Approach

 We have used the models trained by Tal Hassner and Gil Levi. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100).

We have done as follow:
1. Detection of faces
2. Classification into Male/Female
3. Classification into one of the age group
